This a a to-do list that will use negative reinforcement to encourage you to get things done - much like your evil boss 5 years ago.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this project. I still nned to work on the emails that pop up when you uncross an item on your list. I would like to work on learning flex and grid. I really got to use my creativity and think outside of the boxin this project, which is always a good workout for your brain.

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
